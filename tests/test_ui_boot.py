"""Boot channel selection and setup-screen structure in ui/app.js.

Two regressions are guarded here, both found the hard way:

1. The native-window blank screen: app.js runs before pywebview injects its
   bridge, and pywebview's own HTTP server has no /api route (it answers 405),
   so falling through to fetch renders nothing at all.
2. Instruction text naming a button that is not on screen. The wizard used to
   render both the setup flow and the reference guide from one function with
   `review ? a : b` in the labels, so prose saying "press Verify below" sat
   under a button reading DONE. Button labels are consts now, and the two
   purposes are separate functions.

These are source-text assertions. They cannot prove the UI renders (only a
screenshot does that, see CLAUDE.md section 10), but they do pin the structural
choices that stop the bug class from coming back.
